			<p>For our third project, Alex, Russell and I had to create a 6 panel "interactive" comic using Adobe Illustrator and/or Photoshop to create the content. The project had to include some original content and live on a web page. We dedided to create "The Little Things". Throughout the course of our college life here at NYUAD, we all experience little inconveniences. These tiny gripes, no matter how insignificant, can be exacerbated by the stresses of schoolwork and other aspects of our daily lives. However, it doesn't have to be like this. If you just stop and take the time to view things from a different perspective, then suddenly you'll realise that life isn't that bad after all.This is what we hoped to capture with our comic.
